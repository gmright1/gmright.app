Human, Jesus Christ Loves you unconditionally. He cares for you more than you can ever fathom or know. He is God, the creator of heaven and earth, but when He knew you would come into the world and you'd need forgiveness, He humbled Himself, and came to die for you and me. The Bible says, if we acknowledge our sins He is faithful and Just to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness. Do not worry about anything in your life, what you're going to wear or eat because The Lord is our Shepherd and our Provider, He provides for us.
