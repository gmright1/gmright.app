But if you don't want to hear this, then you won't be able to understand why I have to hold back, even if I Love you George. The friendship door is the only one I can open right now for you. But I also don't want you hurting man, I want you happy and fulfilled. And of that means you being with someone. And telling me that we never met. Fine then okay.
